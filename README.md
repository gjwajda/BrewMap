Displays an interactive map using the Google Maps API. Using the BreweryDB API, I have marked the locations of the breweries in Illinois. When you click on the map marker, a display will pop up giving you the info on that specific brewery. The idea is to have a visual display where people can look at nearby breweries and check information such as ratings, beer they serve, time they are open, etc. It is meant to make the search easier and less of a hassle for the user.
